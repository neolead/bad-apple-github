# GitHub Calendar Bad Apple Dance ðŸŽµ

![Bad Apple Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neolead/bad-apple-github/refs/heads/main/Bad_apple_github_mus.gif)

**Turn your GitHub profile into a musical spectacle!**

This project combines a built-in MIDI player and synthesizer with a visualization of the iconic "Bad Apple" dance on your GitHub contributions calendar. Watch as your calendar transforms into a dynamic canvas, syncing animations with music.

## Features

- **Built-in MIDI Player & Synthesizer**:  
  The script includes a custom MIDI player with multiple instruments (`marimba`, `piano`, `organ`) and supports ADSR envelopes for realistic sound synthesis.

- **Dynamic Calendar Animation**:  
  The GitHub contributions calendar is transformed into a pixel-art display, showcasing the "Bad Apple" animation frame by frame.

- **Customizable Palette**:  
  The color palette can be inverted or modified to match your preferences.

- **Seamless Integration**:  
  The script runs directly in the browser, leveraging the GitHub contributions calendar for a unique visual experience.

## How It Works

### MIDI Playback
- The script processes a sequence of MIDI notes (`notes` array) and assigns them to different instruments (`instruments` array).
- Each note is played with precise timing, velocity, and duration using the Web Audio API.
- Instruments are cycled through dynamically to create a rich, layered sound.

### Calendar Animation
- The GitHub contributions calendar is treated as a grid of pixels.
- Frames of the "Bad Apple" animation are pre-rendered as base64-encoded images.
- Each frame is mapped to the calendar grid, updating the background color of each cell to create a smooth animation.

### Text Overlay
- Before the main animation starts, the text "BAD APPLE" is displayed on the calendar using a monospace font.
- After 4 seconds, the calendar transitions to the main animation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser with support for the Web Audio API and JavaScript ES6+.
- Access to your GitHub profile page with a visible contributions calendar.

### Usage
1. Open your GitHub profile page in a browser.
2. Copy the entire script and paste it into the browser's developer console (F12 â†’ Console tab).
3. Press Enter to run the script.

The animation will start immediately, and the MIDI synthesizer will play the "Bad Apple" theme.

## Technical Details

### MIDI Synthesizer
The synthesizer is implemented using the Web Audio API. Each instrument has the following properties:

- `oscType`: Oscillator type (`square`, `triangle`, `sawtooth`).
- `detune`: Fine-tuning in cents (+/- values).
- `octave`: Octave shift (positive or negative).
- `envelope`: ADSR envelope parameters (`attack`, `decay`, `sustain`, `release`).
- `amp`: Amplitude multiplier.

Example instrument configuration:

```javascript
{
  name: 'marimba',
  oscType: 'square',
  detune: 3, // +3 cents
  octave: -1, // Lowered by one octave
  envelope: { attack: 0.005, decay: 0.1, sustain: 0.2, release: 0.2 },
  amp: 0.3
}
```

### Calendar Animation
- The calendar grid is treated as an 18x14 pixel canvas.
- Each frame of the animation is encoded as a base64 image and rendered on the canvas.
- Pixel colors are mapped to the GitHub contributions palette (`#ebedf0`, `#9be9a8`, etc.).

### Text Display
- The text "BAD APPLE" is rendered on a hidden canvas using a monospace font.
- The text is then mapped to the calendar grid, ensuring proper alignment and visibility.

## Customization

You can modify the following variables to customize the behavior:

- `palette`: Change the color scheme of the calendar.
- `invertPalette`: Reverse the color order.
- `FPS`: Adjust the animation frame rate.
- `DELAY`: Set the delay between frames.
- `OFFSET`: Shift the animation horizontally.

Example:

```javascript
const palette = ['#ffffff', '#cccccc', '#999999', '#666666', '#000000'];
const invertPalette = true;
const FPS = 24; // Increase frame rate
```
